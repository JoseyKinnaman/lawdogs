  <h1>A page about the dogs of law enforcement. At all levels.</h1>
  <h3>Law dogs through the eyes of a civilian dog.</h3>
  <p>Most people, when it comes to where dogs and the law intersect, only think of K9 officers.</p>
  <p>This is certainly not the case. Dogs help enforce, interpret, and challenge the law at all levels. For instance, there are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>K9 officers, obviously</li>
    <li>Dog lawyers</li>
    <li>Dog judges</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are also dogs on the other side of the law, which law dogs work especially hard to bring to justice.</p>
  <p>Click <a href=""></a>here</a> to see some of those.</p>
